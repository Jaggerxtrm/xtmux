# XTRM Agent Workflow

> Full reference: `XTRM-GUIDE.md` | Session manual: `/using-xtrm` skill.
> This is a compact managed block. Use CLI `--help` and skills for details; do not paste full manuals here.

## Session start

1. `bd prime` — load workflow context and active claims.
2. `bd memories <topic>` / `bd recall <key>` — retrieve durable context before answering questions or changing workflow-sensitive code.
3. Catch up on recent work: check handoff/next-session beads, latest `xt report` handoffs, recent merged/closed PRs, and `bd list --status=in_progress`.
4. `bv --robot-triage --format toon` or `bv --robot-next` — choose work when needed. Never run bare `bv`.
5. If board state is unclear, run `/issue-triage` or the robot triage/plan commands before editing.
6. For service/docs/project context, run `/scope` or `/using-service-skills`; note stale/missing service skills before relying on them.
7. `bd ready` / `bd show <id>` / `bd update <id> --claim` — inspect and claim before edits.
8. If the runtime supports local task planning, use it before non-trivial work and keep it synchronized with the active bead.

## Operating rules

- Beads is authoritative for ownership, dependencies, memory gates, and closure.
- Runtime-local task plans are ephemeral execution tracking only; they do not replace beads.
- Close beads and satisfy memory ack before commit: `bd remember` when useful, then `bd kv set memory-acked:<id> saved:<key>` or `nothing novel:<reason>`, then `bd close <id> --reason="..."`.
- Ask before destructive, irreversible, production-impacting, or history-rewriting actions.
- Do not ask repetitive “Proceed?” confirmations for normal implementation once scope is clear.

## Essential command surface

Use these as the minimal operational surface; use `--help` for full syntax.

- `bd prime`, `bd ready`, `bd list --status=in_progress`, `bd show <id>`
- `bd update <id> --claim`, `bd remember "<insight>"`, `bd close <id> --reason="..."`
- `bv --robot-triage --format toon`, `bv --robot-next` — never bare `bv`
- `xt report list` / latest report file, `xt update --apply`, `xt end`
- `gh pr list --state merged --limit 5` or equivalent host CLI when PR context matters
- `sp --help`, `sp list` / `specialists list`, `sp ps`, `sp feed <job-id>`, `sp result <job-id>`

## Skill routing

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| xtrm/beads workflow | `/using-xtrm`; `bd --help`; `xt --help` |
| Specialist orchestration | latest `/using-specialists-*`, prefer `/using-specialists-v3`; check `sp --help` + `sp list` first |
| Service/docs/project context | canonical service-skills skill set: `/scope`, `/using-service-skills` |
| Planning/tests/docs | `/planning`, `/test-planning`, `/sync-docs` |
| Board unclear/backlog messy | `/issue-triage`; `bv --robot-triage --format toon`; `bv --robot-plan` |
| Release/session close | `/releasing`, `/xt-end`, `/session-close-report`, `/xt-merge` |

## Code intelligence and edits

- Before editing an existing function/class/method, run GitNexus impact analysis when GitNexus is available.
- Warn before proceeding if impact risk is HIGH or CRITICAL.
- For unfamiliar code, inspect execution flows before broad grep-heavy reads.
- Before commit or handoff, verify affected scope.
- Prefer targeted symbol/file reads and precise edits over whole-tree dumps.

## Quality gates

- Run targeted tests/build/typecheck relevant to changed files.
- Use background process tooling for long-running servers, watchers, and log tails.
- Fix quality failures before commit.

## Worktree sessions

- `xt pi` — launch Pi in a sandboxed worktree.
- `xt end` — close session: commit / push / PR / cleanup when appropriate.

# Agent Instructions

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` for full workflow context.

> **Architecture in one line:** Issues live in a local Dolt database
> (`.beads/dolt/`); cross-machine sync uses `bd dolt push/pull` (a
> git-compatible protocol), stored under `refs/dolt/data` on your git
> remote — separate from `refs/heads/*` where your code lives.
> `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export, not the wire protocol.
>
> See [SYNC_CONCEPTS.md](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md)
> for the one-screen overview and anti-patterns (don't treat JSONL as the
> source of truth; don't `bd import` during normal operation; don't
> reach for third-party Dolt hosting before trying the default).

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work atomically
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd dolt push          # Push beads data to remote
```

## Non-Interactive Shell Commands

**ALWAYS use non-interactive flags** with file operations to avoid hanging on confirmation prompts.

Shell commands like `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` may be aliased to include `-i` (interactive) mode on some systems, causing the agent to hang indefinitely waiting for y/n input.

**Use these forms instead:**
```bash
# Force overwrite without prompting
cp -f source dest           # NOT: cp source dest
mv -f source dest           # NOT: mv source dest
rm -f file                  # NOT: rm file

# For recursive operations
rm -rf directory            # NOT: rm -r directory
cp -rf source dest          # NOT: cp -r source dest
```

**Other commands that may prompt:**
- `scp` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` for non-interactive
- `ssh` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` to fail instead of prompting
- `apt-get` - use `-y` flag
- `brew` - use `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` env var

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **xtmux** (906 symbols, 1864 relationships, 68 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({search_query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
